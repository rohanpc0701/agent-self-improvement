"""Generate mock data so all four stages can build in parallel WITHOUT the real loop.

Produces (in repo root / fixtures):
  fixtures/mock_telemetry.jsonl  -> for the DETECTOR (baseline -> degraded -> recovery stream)
  fixtures/mock_drift_events.jsonl -> for CORRECTION (a couple of drift events + failing cases)
  fixtures/mock_events.jsonl     -> for the VIEWER (full typed event stream: telemetry+drift+correction)

Shape matches rules/02: change-point on a stratified stream. Per-query accuracy is noisy;
the windowed average is smooth. Run once from repo root:  python fixtures/generate_mocks.py
